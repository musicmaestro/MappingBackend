# MappingBackend
Mapping Backend. Utilising Symfony framework
This backend acts both as a response API to the mapping frontend http://www.historymap.info, but also middleware to the local history 
wiki at http://wiki.historymap.info. Some 'bot' functionality is to be included in this as opposed to the wiki API to keep that
as 'vanilla' as possible.
